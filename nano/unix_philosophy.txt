The Unix Philosophy
From The UNIX Programming Environment(1984) by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike

Eventhough the UNIX system introduces a number of innovative programs and 
techniques, no signel program or idea makes it work well.  Instead, what 
makes it effective is the approach to programming, a philosophy of using the 
computer. ALthought that philosophy can't be written down in a single 
sentecnce, at its heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more 
from the relationships among programs than from the programs themseleves.  
Many UNIX programs do quite trivial things in isolation, but, combined with 
other programs, become general and useful tools.
